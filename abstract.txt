Understanding how adaptation has shaped variation across
populations for a wide array of traits is a topic of great
interest in evolutionary biology. One commonly used tool to
aid in this endeavor is the Q_st/F_st comparison. In the simplest
version, one measures the fraction of additive genetic variance 
for a quantitative trait that is among populations rather than
within (Q_st), and then compares that value to F_st, an identical
measure for neutral genetic variation. Under a set 
of restrictive assumptions, Q_st will be equal to F_st on
average if the trait is neutral, and the distribution of 
their ratio will be chi-squared.

In the last decade, there has been a resurgence of statistical 
methods development work focused on expanding the general Q_st/F_st
framework to use more of the available data, either incorporating 
information about the genetic covariances among multiple traits 
which one may wish to examine concurrently, or about patterns of 
population structure which are not adequately captured by the 
univariate measure F_st.

Building on this work, we show that the Q_st/F_st comparison can
be see as a special case of a very general multivariate
hypothesis testing framework. Using theory and simulations,
we show how this generalized Q_st/F_st framework admits 
wide flexibility for investigators to chose specific hypotheses
about the data they wish to test, providing increased statistical
power and resolution to identify traits or populations which may 
be of further interest.
